Just an experiment/showcase of a simple neural network in golang. I don't recommend using this for anything (including educational purposes) - it's not particularly well documented, and I'm still very new to golang. If you do want to run main.go, download both datasets from https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/ and drop them into /datasets
